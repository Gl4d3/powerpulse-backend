Of course. Based on the extensive research you've provided and the context of your data, let's synthesize this information into a clear, actionable plan to measure customer satisfaction using a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) derived from your conversation transcripts.

Making Sense of the Research: CSAT vs. CSI

First, let's clarify the core confusion that appeared in your research prompts. You are correct to question why one satisfaction score (CSAT) would be used to calculate another (CSI).

CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score): Think of this as a snapshot. It's a transactional metric that measures satisfaction with a single, specific interaction. The classic example is a post-chat survey asking, "How satisfied were you with this chat?" It answers the question, "Was the customer happy with this one thing we just did?"

CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index): This is the album. It's a composite, strategic metric that provides a holistic view of customer satisfaction by aggregating several different attributes or factors. It answers the broader question, "How happy is the customer with us overall, considering everything?"

Conclusion from your research: Using CSAT as the only input for CSI is redundant and misses the point. The real power of CSI comes from combining various metrics—like Customer Effort Score (CES), efficiency metrics, and sentiment—to create a much richer, more accurate picture of satisfaction. CSAT can be one ingredient, but it shouldn't be the whole recipe.

The Plan: Building a CSI from Conversation Transcripts

Our goal is to create a deterministic CSI score calculated at the conversation level, which can then be aggregated for a global view. We will structure this by defining classes of attributes, populating them with specific metrics from your chat data, and then assigning weights to them.

Based on your research (specifically Research 8), we can group the metrics into four primary classes:

Effectiveness: Was the customer's issue resolved?

Effort: How easy was it for the customer to get a resolution?

Efficiency: How fast and streamlined was the interaction?

Empathy: How did the interaction make the customer feel?

Step 1: Define Metrics for Each Class

Here are the specific scores we can derive from your conversation JSON, indicating which require an LLM. Each metric should be normalized to a 1-10 scale at the conversation level.

Class	Metric	How to Calculate from Chat JSON	LLM Required?
Effectiveness	Resolution Achieved	The LLM analyzes the entire conversation to determine if the customer's initial problem was solved or their question was answered. It looks for confirmation from the customer (e.g., "Okay thanks," "Power is restored thanks") or a clear resolution provided by the agent.	Yes
	First Contact Resolution (FCR)	The LLM determines if the issue was resolved within a single, continuous conversation thread without the customer having to follow up later. A follow-up message from the customer hours or a day later on the same topic would result in a low FCR score.	Yes
Effort	Customer Effort Score (CES)	The LLM infers the effort level by detecting signs of customer friction. This includes repeating questions, expressing confusion ("I don't understand"), re-explaining the issue, or having to provide the same information multiple times. A smooth, linear conversation gets a high score (low effort).	Yes
Efficiency	First Response Time	Timestamp of first "to_client" agent message - Timestamp of first "to_company" customer message. This raw time (in minutes) is then converted to a 1-10 scale (e.g., <1 min = 10, 1-3 min = 9, >30 min = 1).	No
	Average Resolution Time	Timestamp of the final message in a resolved thread - Timestamp of the first "to_company" message. This is also converted to a 1-10 scale.	No
Empathy	Sentiment Score	The LLM analyzes the sentiment of the customer's messages throughout the conversation. It detects words expressing frustration, anger, or gratitude. The final score reflects the overall emotional tone from the customer's side.	Yes
	Sentiment Shift	The LLM compares the sentiment of the customer's initial messages to their final messages. A positive shift (e.g., from frustrated to thankful) results in a high score, indicating the agent successfully de-escalated and improved the customer's emotional state.	Yes
Step 2: The Role of the LLM - Per-Conversation Analysis

For each chat_id, you will feed the entire conversation transcript to an LLM. The LLM's task is to return a structured JSON output with its analysis for the metrics that require it.

Prompt Structure for LLM:
"You are a customer service quality analyst for an electricity provider. Analyze the following conversation transcript. Based only on the text, provide a score from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) for each of the following metrics: Resolution Achieved, First Contact Resolution, Customer Effort Score, Sentiment Score, and Sentiment Shift. For each score, provide a brief justification in one sentence."

Expected LLM Output per Conversation:

{
  "resolution_achieved": {
    "score": 9,
    "justification": "The agent provided a reference number and the customer later confirmed the power was restored."
  },
  "first_contact_resolution": {
    "score": 4,
    "justification": "The customer had to follow up multiple times over two days before the issue was addressed."
  },
  "customer_effort_score": {
    "score": 3,
    "justification": "The customer had to repeat their reference number and was passed between multiple agents before getting a clear answer."
  },
  "sentiment_score": {
    "score": 4,
    "justification": "The customer expressed frustration and impatience throughout most of the conversation."
  },
  "sentiment_shift": {
    "score": 7,
    "justification": "Although the customer started frustrated, their final message was 'Okay thanks,' indicating a positive shift in sentiment after resolution."
  }
}
Step 3: Calculating the CSI - Weights and Options

Now, we combine the objective (time-based) and LLM-derived scores into a final CSI score for each conversation using a weighted formula:

CSI = (Score_A * Weight_A) + (Score_B * Weight_B) + ...

Drawing from your research (Research 6, 7, & 8), here are three options for weighting. The "Customized for Utilities" option is highly recommended as it aligns best with your business context.

Attribute	Option 1: Basic (Equal Weights)	Option 2: Advanced (Impact-Based)	Option 3: Customized for Utilities (Recommended)
Effectiveness (Resolution)	25%	35%	40%
Effort (CES)	25%	25%	25%
Efficiency (Times)	25%	20%	15%
Empathy (Sentiment)	25%	20%	20%
Total	100%	100%	100%

Why the Customized Weights? For an electricity provider, the single most important factor is resolving the customer's problem (Effectiveness), especially during outages. A friendly but unresolved conversation is still a failure. Customer Effort is next, as a difficult process causes immense frustration. Empathy and Efficiency are important but secondary to getting the lights back on.

Step 4: The Global Dashboard

Your dashboard will aggregate the conversation-level data to provide a high-level view.

Headline Score: Overall CSI

This is the main KPI. It should be the average of the CSI scores from all conversations over a selected period (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days).

Display it prominently with a trend indicator (e.g., "▲ 5% vs. last week").

Trending Attribute Scores

Display line charts for the average score of each of the four main classes: Effectiveness, Effort, Efficiency, and Empathy.

This allows you to diagnose why the overall CSI is changing. For example, you might see that your overall CSI dropped because the Efficiency score plummeted, indicating your agents are taking longer to respond.

Qualitative Insights: Common Topics

Use the LLM to perform topic modeling on all conversations.

Display a bar chart or word cloud of the most common issues (e.g., "Power Outage," "Token Purchase Failed," "Billing Inquiry," "Low Voltage").

This provides crucial context for the quantitative scores. For example, a low Effectiveness score might be driven by a spike in "Token Purchase Failed" issues that your agents are struggling to resolve.

By implementing this plan, you will have a robust, data-driven system for measuring customer satisfaction that is directly derived from your customer interactions and grounded in the extensive research you've conducted.
